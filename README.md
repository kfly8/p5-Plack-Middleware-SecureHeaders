# NAME

Plack::Middleware::SecureHeaders - manage security headers middleware

# SYNOPSIS

```perl
use Plack::Builder;

builder {
    enable 'SecureHeaders';
    $app;
};
```

# DESCRIPTION

This middleware manages HTTP headers to protect against XSS attacks, insecure connections, content type sniffing, etc.
Specifically, this module manages two things. One is Content-Type validation. Second is using [HTTP::SecureHeaders](https://metacpan.org/pod/HTTP%3A%3ASecureHeaders) to set secure HTTP headers.

**NOTE**: To protect against these attacks, sanitization of user input values and other protections are also required.

## OPTIONS

Secure HTTP headers can be changed as follows:

```perl
use Plack::Builder;

builder {
    enable 'SecureHeaders',
        secure_headers => HTTP::SecureHeaders->new(
            x_frame_options => 'DENY'
        );

    $app;
};
```
